<h1>THE ULTIMATE DIRESKIES GUIDE</h1>

		<h2>Mines</h2>
		On the Mainland you will first need to walk to the wood mine.
		<img src="../images/wood_mine.png" alt="Wood Mine" width="735" height="414" class="center-img">
		There are two wood mines in this realm,<br>
		you can find the first one by walking forwards and then left. The second wood mine is on the right.<br>
		It is the same layout for the stone, coal, iron, diamond and emerald mine.<br>
		<h2>Autocompressors</h2>
		One of the most important features on DireSkies are the autocompressors because if you have them unlocked<br>
		you dont need to run back to the shop at spawn if you want to compress a material. Autocompressors are just doing that for you.<br>
		Just go the shop at spawn and in there to the left and right click the Technician and trade for the autocompressor you want to have.<br>
		Then right click anywhere while you are holding the autocompressor. Now you have the autocompressor for this material unlocked.<br>
			Type "/compressor" into chat and a menu with all the compressors will open.<br>
		You are might asking yourself where you can unlock the auto supercompressor and the auto megacompressor.<br>
		You dont have access to these to right now but we will later get into that point.
		<h2>Upgrading tools, weapons and armor</h2>
		First you want to go to one of the two wood mines. There you have to mine four logs with your fist.<br>
		Then you have to look out for the Lumberjack. Right click at the NPC and select the trade for the axe.<br>
		Now you have to upgrade your axe by mining more wood and trading the axe for the next tier axe.<br>
		Once you have reached the final axe tier you have to type /spawn in chat and go to the shop at your left.<br>
		Go to the left in the shop and find the wood pickaxe trader. Then buy the tier one wood pickaxe with four logs.<br>
		Upgrade your pickaxe now and then move to the stone mine. Now mine the stone and buy the stone pickaxes from the shop.<br>
		Repeat the same thing untill you are at the tier eight emerald pickaxe. Now you want to get an elytra.<br>
		For the elytra tier one you have to mine 32 Supercompressed emeralds.<br>
		Also mine one extra supercompressed emerald for some rockets to actually fly.<br>
		Type again /spawn in the chat and turn right. Then walk up the stair untill you reach the stump of the big tree.<br>
		Walk around and look for the Phantom. Right click it and trade the 32 Supercompressed emeralds for the tier one elytra.<br>
		Also buy some rockets with your left over emeralds. Now you can upgrade your elytra to tier three, get a sword, get armor<br>
		or move on to the next realm to upgrade your pickaxe. In my opinion the last option is the best. 
		<h3>Upgrading your elytra, sword or armor</h3>
		To upgrade your elytra you will need to mine some more emeralds. You can look up the prices at the Phantom.<br>
		For getting a sword you will need to start from the beginning again. Mine four wood to get a tier one wooden sword.<br>
		Then keep upgrading it in the shop at spawn untill you are at the tier eight emerald sword.<br>
		To get full armor you also need to start mine wood again. Mine four for every armor piece and then trade it for the armor.<br>
		Then also upgrade your armor untill you have emerald eight armor.
		<h3>The next realm</h3>
		The server is based on multiple realms. You can find all of them in the navigationbar at the top of your screen.<br>
		But the next would be the Diremines. To get there you need to buy the realm-voucher for 24 supercompressed diamonds and 32 supercompressed emeralds<br>
		The trader for it is found in a little cave right to spawn.
		<img src="../images/diremines_trader.png" alt="Lost Miner" width="735" height="414" class="center-img">
		Right click with the voucher in your hand and type /warp into chat. Now you can also see all the realms listed ingame.<br>
		Click onto the realm you want to travel to. Right now you only have the Mainland and Diremines unlocked.<br>
		If you dont want to click onto the items all the time you can also use "/warp deepmines" to get directly teleported into the Diremines<br>
		<br>
