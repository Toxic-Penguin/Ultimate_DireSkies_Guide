	<h2>Mines</h2>
	On the Mainland you will first need to walk to the wood mine. There are two wood mines in this realm, <br>
	you can find the first one by walking forwards and then left. The second wood mine is on the right. <br>
	It is the same layout for the stone, coal, iron, diamond and emerald mine.<br>
	First you want to go to one of the two wood mines. There you have to mine four logs with your fist.<br>
	Then you have to look out for the Lumberjack. Right click at the NPC and select the trade for the axe.<br>
	Now you have to upgrade your axe by mining mor wood and trading the axe for the next tier axe.<br>
	Once you have reached the final axe tier you have to type /spawn in chat and go to the shop at your left.<br>
	Go to the left in the shop and find the wood pickaxe trader. Then buy the tier one wood pickaxe with four logs. <br>
	Upgrade your pickaxe now and then move to the stone mine. Now mine the stone and buy the stone pickaxes from the shop. <br>
	Repeat the same thing untill you are at the tier 8 emerald pickaxe. Now 
	With the materials you obtained from mining you can type /spawn into the chat and you will be teleported to spawn.<br>
	Then turn left and walk into the shop. In the shop you can upgrade your pickaxe, armor and sword.
