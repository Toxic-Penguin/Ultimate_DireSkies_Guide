	<h2>Mines</h2>
	On the Mainland you will first need to walk to the wood mine. There are two wood mines in this realm,<br>
	you can find the first one by walking forwards and then left. The second wood mine is on the right.<br>
	It is the same layout for the stone, coal, iron, diamond and emerald mine.<br>
	<h2>Upgrading tools, weapons and armor</h2>
	First you want to go to one of the two wood mines. There you have to mine four logs with your fist.<br>
	Then you have to look out for the Lumberjack. Right click at the NPC and select the trade for the axe.<br>
	Now you have to upgrade your axe by mining more wood and trading the axe for the next tier axe.<br>
	Once you have reached the final axe tier you have to type /spawn in chat and go to the shop at your left.<br>
	Go to the left in the shop and find the wood pickaxe trader. Then buy the tier one wood pickaxe with four logs.<br>
	Upgrade your pickaxe now and then move to the stone mine. Now mine the stone and buy the stone pickaxes from the shop.<br>
	Repeat the same thing untill you are at the tier eight emerald pickaxe. Now you want to get an elytra.<br>
	For the elytra tier one you have to mine 32 Supercompressed emeralds.<br>
	Also mine one extra supercompressed emerald for some rockets to actually fly.<br>
	Type again /spawn in the chat and turn right. Then walk up the stair untill you reach the stump of the big tree.<br>
	Walk around and look for the Phantom. Right click it and trade the 32 Supercompressed emeralds for the tier one Elytra.<br>
	Also buy some rockets with your left over emeralds. Now you can upgrade your elytra to tier three, get a sword, get armor<br>
	or move on to the next realm to upgrade your pickaxe. In my opinion the last option is the best. 
	<h3>Upgrading your elytra, sword or armor</h3>
	To upgrade your elytra you will need to mine some more emeralds. You can look up the prices at the Phantom.<br>
	For getting a sword you will need to start from the beginning again. Mine four wood to get a tier one wooden sword.<br>
	Then keep upgrading it in the shop at spawn untill you are at the tier eight emerald sword.<br>
	To get full armor you also need to start mine wood again. Mine four for every armor piece and then trade it for the armor.<br>
	Then also upgrade your armor untill you have emerald eight armor.
	<h3>The next realm</h3>
